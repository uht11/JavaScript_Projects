# My JavaScript Projects
This repository contains a collection of my JavaScript projects. The projects cover a variety of topics, including:

Web development: I have created several web applications using JavaScript. These applications include a to-do list, a weather app, and a simple blog.
Game development: I have also created several games using JavaScript. These games include a platformer, a puzzle game, and a text adventure.
Data visualization: I have used JavaScript to create several data visualizations. These visualizations include a bar chart, a pie chart, and a heat map.
I am always working on new JavaScript projects, and I hope you will enjoy browsing through my repository.
